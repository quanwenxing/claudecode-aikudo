# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a standalone TODO application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No build tools or package managers are required.

## Running the Application

Open `todo.html` directly in a browser:
```bash
open todo.html
```

## Architecture

- **Single-file architecture**: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are contained in `todo.html`
- **Data persistence**: Uses localStorage with key `kokoroecho-todos`
- **Design theme**: Japanese-inspired "和風モダン" (Wa-fu Modern) aesthetic using Zen Antique and Zen Kaku Gothic New fonts
